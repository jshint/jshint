# How to contribute

The best way to make sure your issue is addressed is to submit a patch. We accept
patches through all mediums: pull requests, email, issue comment, tweet with a link
to a snippet, graffiti outside of Anton's apartment, etc.

However, before sending a patch, please make sure that the following applies:

* Your commit message follows the [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines).
* You have signed the [Contributor's License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/jshint/jshint).
* Your patch doesn't have useless merge commits.
* Your coding style is similar to ours (see below).
* Your patch is 100% tested. We don't accept any test regressions.
* All tests and lint checks pass (`npm test`).
* You understand that we're super grateful for your patch.

## Development Environment

JSHint is developed using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and has a number of
dependencies specified in its `package.json` file. To install them just run the
following command from within your repo directory:

    $ npm install

After that, you will be able to run the edge version of JSHint using
`bin/jshint` or build the release bundles using `bin/build`.

## Issue Priority

When verifying bug reports and feature requests, the JSHint team will assign
one of the following labels to document the report's severity:

- *P1:* Something is throwing exceptions; broken JSHint backward compatibility.
- *P2:* Something is not being parsed correctly.
- *P3:* Features that the core team will work on once P2s and P1s are done.
- *P4:* Patches welcome; The request is good, but low priority.

## Coding Style

This section describes our coding style guide. You might not agree with it and
that's fine but if you're going to send us patches treat this guide as a law.

**Our main rule is simple:**

> All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no
> matter how many people contributed.
> â€”[idiomatic.js](https://github.com/rwaldron/idiomatic.js/)

### Whitespace

* We use two spaces everywhere.
* Use one space after `if`, `for`, `while`, etc.
* No spaces between `function` and `(` for anonymous functions, no space between name and `(`  for named functions:

    ```javascript
    var a = function() {};
    function a() {}
    ```

* Feel free to indent variable assignments or property definitions if it makes the code look better. But don't abuse that:

    ```javascript
    // Good
    var next = token.peak();
    var prev = token.peak(-1);
    var cur  = token.current;

    var scope = {
      name:   "(global)",
      parent: parentScope,
      vars:   [],
      uses:   []
    };

    // Bad
    var cur         = token.current;
    var isSemicolon = cur.isPunctuator(";");
    ```

* Wrap multi-line comments with new lines on both sides.

### Variables

* Use one `var` per variable unless you don't assign any values to it (and it's short enough):

    ```javascript
    var token = tokens.find(index);
    var scope = scopes.current;
    var next, prev, cur;
    ```

* Don't be overly descriptive with your variable names but don't abuse one-letter variables either. Find a sweet spot somewhere in between.

### Comments

* Comment everything that is not obvious.
* If you're adding a new check, write a comment describing why this check is important and what it checks for.

### Misc

* Always use strict mode.
* Always use strict comparisons: `===` and `!==`.
* Use semicolons.
* Don't use comma-first notation.
* Try not to chain stuff unless it **really** helps (e.g. in tests).
* Don't short-circuit expressions if you're not assigning the result:

    ```javascript
    // Good
    token = token || tokens.find(0);

    // Bad
    token.isPunctuator(";") && report.addWarning("W001");

    // Good
    if (token.isPunctuator(";"))
      report.addWarning("W001");
    ```

## Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages are written in a simple format which clearly describes the purpose of a change.

The format in general should look like this:

```
[[TYPE]] <Short description>
<Blank line>

<Body / Detailed description>

<Footer>
```

Line lengths in commit messages are not strict, but good commit messages should have headers of no
more than 60 characters, and bodies/footers wrapped at 100 columns. This renders nicely on Github's
UI.

### Header

The first line is the commit message header, which will indicate the type of change, and a general
description of the change. This should fit within 60 characters, ideally. For instance:

```
[[FIX]] Ignore "nocomma" when parsing object literals
```

The title `[[FIX]]` indicates that the change is a bugfix, while the remainder clarifies what the
change actually contains.

Several commit types are used by jshint:

1. `[[FIX]]` --- Commit fixes a bug or regression
2. `[[FEAT]]` --- Commit introduces new functionality
3. `[[DOCS]]` --- Commit modifies documentation. Docs commits should only touch comments in source code, or scripts and assets which are used to generate the documentation.
4. `[[TEST]]` --- Commit modifies tests or test infrastructure only
5. `[[CHORE]]` --- Commit affects dev-ops, CI, or package dependencies

### Body

`<Body>` is a detailed commit message explaining exactly what has changed, and a summary of the
reason why. Lines in the body should be wrapped to 100 characters for best rendering.

For a historical example, see this [example](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/commit/5751c5ed249b7a035758a3ae876cfa1a360fd144)

### Footer

`<Footer>` contains a description of any breaking changes, no matter how subtle, as well as a list
of issues affected or fixed by this commit. Lines in the footer should be wrapped to 100 characters
for best rendering.

For instance:

```
[[FEAT]] Enable `norecurs` option by default

Commit 124124a7f introduced an option which forbids recursion. We liked it so much, we've enabled
it by default.

BREAKING CHANGE:

This change will break the CI builds of many applications and frameworks.

In order to work around this issue, you will need to re-engineer your applications and frameworks
to avoid making recursive calls. Use Arrays as stacks rather than relying on the VM call stack.

Fixes #1000009
Closes #888888
Closes #77777
