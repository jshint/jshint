JSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems
in JavaScript code. It is very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your
particular coding guidelines and the environment you expect your code to
execute in.

## Reporting a bug

To report a bug simply create a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe
your problem or suggestion. We welcome all kinds of feedback regarding
JSHint including but not limited to:

 * When JSHint doesn't work as expected
 * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers
 * When you simply want a new option or feature

Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets
that cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.

## Issue Priority

- *P1:* Something is throwing exceptions; broken JSHint backward compatibility.
- *P2:* Something is not being parsed correctly.
- *P3:* Features that the core team will work on once P2s and P1s are done.
- *P4:* Patches welcome; The request is good, but low priority.
