JSHint is a community-driven tool to detect errors and potential problems
in JavaScript code and to enforce your team’s coding conventions. It is
very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your particular coding guidelines
and the environment you expect your code to execute in.

#### Reporting a bug

To report a bug simply create a
[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe
your problem or suggestion. We welcome all kind of feedback regarding
JSHint including but not limited to:

 * When JSHint doesn't work as expected
 * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers
 * When you simply want a new option or feature

Before reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets
that cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.
